Plant Leaf Disease Detection System â€” AI & Computer Vision Project
Developed an intelligent system capable of detecting and classifying diseases in fruit and vegetable plant leaves using deep learning and computer vision.
The model analyzes leaf images, identifies the type of disease, and highlights the infected region with high precision to support early agricultural intervention and reduce crop losses.
The system achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in disease classification.

Technologies: Python, TensorFlow / Keras, OpenCV, Image Processing, CNNs
